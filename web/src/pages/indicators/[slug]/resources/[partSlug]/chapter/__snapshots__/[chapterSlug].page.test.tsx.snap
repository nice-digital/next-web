                to obtain a range of views, experiences and expertise, independent from the committee. This can be done either to inform the draft recommendations, or to test the feasibility of implementing the draft recommendations or their relevance and acceptability to those who use the guideline or who will be affected by the guideline.

                Commissioned primary research can occasionally be useful for addressing topic areas where there is limited or no evidence. Commissioned primary research usually uses methods such as focus groups, interviews or online surveys. It involves health and care professionals, people using services and carers, or both. Commissioned primary research may also include quantitative analysis of real-world data sources such as audit datasets. The research should happen during the development of the guideline (before routine stakeholder consultation), and the committee should use the findings as part of the evidence base for developing recommendations.

                    Developers should contact NICE staff with responsibility for quality assurance for initial discussion as soon as the need for additional consultation is identified. If the work is likely to involve people using services or their carers, the developer should also discuss their plans with NICE public involvement staff.

                  <p>
                    The proposal needs to be signed off by NICE staff with responsibility for quality assurance, and all comments and responses need to be publicly available, as with a routine stakeholder consultation. If the purpose of the additional consultation is to test the feasibility of implementing guideline recommendations, it may be useful to involve a member of the NICE field team for advice and support.

                    Commissioned primary research usually uses methods such as focus groups, interviews or online surveys. It involves health and care professionals, people using services and carers, or both. Commissioned primary research may also include quantitative analysis of real-world data sources such as audit datasets.

                          The guideline on the link between BMI and ill health and premature death in black, Asian and other minority ethnic groups. Analysis of a UK dataset (ADDITION-Leicester) was commissioned to supplement the published non-UK literature. The data was analysed to assess the following question: what are the cut-off points for BMI and waist circumference among adults from black, Asian and other minority ethnic groups living in the UK that are 'risk equivalent' to the current thresholds set for white European populations?

                    Developers should contact NICE staff with responsibility for quality assurance for initial discussion as soon as the need for commissioned primary research is identified. If the work is likely to involve people using services or their carers, the developer should also discuss their plans with NICE public involvement staff, who can advise on options and methods for involving people affected by the guideline. They can also advise on external resources and sources of more specialist advice.

                      Once the aim of the commissioned primary research is agreed, the developer should then discuss the commissioning process with NICE staff with responsibility for quality assurance. Commissioned primary research is usually conducted by an external contractor. 
                    </p>
                    
        
                    <p>
                      When the decision is made to commission an external contractor, the developer and NICE should consider an academic or research organisation, or an organisation that works with people affected by the guideline and has research expertise. This organisation should be separate from the team involved in compiling evidence reviews for the guideline and the committee, unless there are exceptional circumstances (for example, specific expertise in the topic or access to specialist networks is needed). However, the team may be asked to help the contractor, for example by generating a list of participants. 
                    </p>
                    
        
                    <p>
                      The contractor should have a good record of research in the proposed field (for example qualitative or participatory research), and ideally should have experience in the topic area, as well as expertise in working with the people who will be affected by the guideline.
                    </p>
                    
        
                    <p>
                      The developer should document the reasons for the commissioned primary research, with a proposal including the methods to be used, and the anticipated time and costs. The proposal should be discussed with members of NICE staff with responsibility for quality assurance, and approved by the centre director. If the work is approved, the reasons and methods should be documented in the guideline.
                    </p>
                    
        
                    <p>
                      If an external contractor is commissioned, the commissioning process should follow NICE's Standing Financial Instructions. This involves developing a project specification, issuing invitations to tender and selecting a contractor based on clear and auditable criteria.

                      The developer and external contractor (if commissioned) should consider the recruitment strategy carefully, taking into account the purpose of the commissioned primary research, the topic, the groups, the range of views needed, and other relevant issues.

                      When planning commissioned primary research with children and young people, school holidays and exam schedules should be taken into account.

                      Equality issues should be fully considered when choosing participants. This may mean getting a representative spread of practitioners or people using services, but it may also mean focusing on participants from seldom heard groups or people with recent experience of working with them.

                    Commissioned primary research can involve a number of approaches and methods. NICE, the relevant committee and the developer or external contractor should consider the choice of methods carefully, taking into account the topic, the groups involved and other issues. When involving people affected by the guideline, the methods and materials used should be tailored to the age, ability and culture of participants. Commissioned primary research may include the use of groups, 1-to-1 or paired in-depth interviews or surveys. In some cases – for example, if a range of groups are involved – a combination of approaches may be used.

                      Interviews may be structured or semi-structured, depending on the topic and the groups involved. Semi-structured interviews allow complex or difficult issues to be explored and so are likely to be more useful than a fixed-format interview. They should focus on, for example, areas in which views and experiences are needed, or the draft recommendations.

                      Individual or paired interviews are usually more expensive to set up than group work, and the need for in-depth or individual contact should be weighed against the available resources at the planning stage.

                      Group-based methods and 1-to-1 or paired interviews are the best way to find out opinions. But they are not suitable in all circumstances, for example, because of the sensitivity of the topic, confidentiality issues, or difficulties in recruiting participants. In such cases, surveys that use semi-structured and open-ended questions could be more appropriate. Surveys may be carried out by telephone, online, on paper or by using vote casting or polling.

                      Surveys gather opinions in a quick and less obtrusive manner than group-based approaches and interviews. The responses can also be quantified. But surveys do not allow the same depth of exploration and, generally, should only be used if other methods are unsuitable. Formal consensus methods such as

                    <p>
                      There are different ways of analysing data from commissioned primary research, depending on the methods used for data collection and whether it is qualitative or quantitative. Some descriptive summary statistics should be provided, for example, characteristics of participants and attendance or response rates.
                    </p>
                    
        
                    <p>
                      Quantitative analysis should include a clear statistical data analysis plan, including a priori plans for sub-group analysis or co-variate adjustments.
                    </p>
                    
        
                    <p>
                      Group-based methods and interviews are likely to generate qualitative data. Analysis may be performed using qualitative research software, or by hand, but the method should be fully reported in the proposal and the final report. 
                    </p>
                    
        
                    <p>
                      Qualitative data can be broken down into common and consistent themes for each of the questions asked, using, for example, a content analysis approach. Usually, 1 researcher should prepare an initial analysis, which should be verified by 'blind' coding and sorting of a sample of the transcript by a second researcher. For examples of this kind of analysis, see part 3 (chapters 7 to 13) of Silverman (2004) or Ritchie and Spencer (1993).

                      Once the analysis is complete, participants' quotes may be selected to illustrate each theme. These quotes should be coded to keep participants anonymous and to allow the quotes to be distinguished. When transcripts are processed, ensure confidentiality and data protection are fully considered. As with data from clinical trials, transcripts should be kept for at least 5 years (see

                      Surveys are likely to involve a mixture of quantitative and qualitative data. Quantitative data may be analysed and presented using summary statistics, or involve more advanced approaches such as regression analysis and multi-variable adjustments (which need agreeing a priori). These could be generated using various statistical software or calculators. When formal consensus methods such as Delphi survey and RAND appropriateness have been modified for the survey, specific analytical methods, for example, thresholds for agreement, should be stated in the proposal and the final report.

                      The developer or external contractor (if commissioned) should ensure the methods for analysing the data and reporting standards are discussed and agreed with NICE.

                    In principle, most primary research that is commissioned for NICE guidelines falls into the category of 'service evaluation' and so is outside the remit of NHS research ethics committees. However, NICE, the developer and external contractor (if commissioned) should consider the ethical issues each time commissioned primary research is planned, to ensure appropriate expertise, and that policies and procedures are in place for the safety and welfare of participants. If there is any doubt, the developer or external contractor should consult the national

                    The findings and the quality of the evidence should be presented to the guideline committee and used to inform the guideline recommendations. The developer may present a summary of all the findings to the committee, and the committee should use this information to refine and prioritise the recommendations before the public consultation. How the findings are used to inform committee's decision-making should be documented in the discussion section of the evidence reviews. The final report of the commissioned primary research should be made available for the routine stakeholder consultation as appendices of the guideline.

    <a id=\\"appendix-b-approaches-to-additional-consultation-and-commissioned-primary-research\\"></a>Appendix B: Approaches to additional consultation and commissioned primary research</h2>
  <p>An additional consultation for a guideline is considered only on an exceptional basis and is additional to the routine stakeholder consultations (see the <a class=\\"link\\" href=\\"https://www.nice.org.uk/process/pmg20/chapter/the-validation-process-for-draft-guidelines-and-dealing-with-stakeholder-comments#what-happens-during-consultation\\" target=\\"_top\\">section of the manual on what happens during consultation in the chapter on the validation process for draft guidelines, and dealing with stakeholder comments</a>). Additional consultation is a targeted engagement exercise <a id=\\"_Hlk71020670\\"></a>to obtain a range of views, experiences and expertise, independent from the committee. This can be done either to inform the draft recommendations, or to test the feasibility of implementing the draft recommendations or their relevance and acceptability to those who use the guideline or who will be affected by the guideline. </p>
  <p>Commissioned primary research can occasionally be useful for addressing topic areas where there is limited or no evidence. Commissioned primary research usually uses methods such as focus groups, interviews or online surveys. It involves health and care professionals, people using services and carers, or both. Commissioned primary research may also include quantitative analysis of real-world data sources such as audit datasets. The research should happen during the development of the guideline (before routine stakeholder consultation), and the committee should use the findings as part of the evidence base for developing recommendations.</p>
  <p>This appendix outlines approaches that could be used and minimum reporting standards for additional consultation and commissioned primary research. </p>
  <p>Additional consultation and commissioned primary research follow the same process: </p>

      <p>Reasons for additional consultation will vary depending on the topic, and may become apparent at different stages of guideline development.</p>
      <p>The process for additional consultation is similar to the process for routine stakeholder consultation. Additional consultation usually happens before or alongside the routine consultation. Additional consultation may involve health and social care professionals, people using services and carers, or both. Reasons for additional consultation include obtaining views, experiences and expertise on:</p>

      <p>Developers should contact NICE staff with responsibility for quality assurance for initial discussion as soon as the need for additional consultation is identified. If the work is likely to involve people using services or their carers, the developer should also discuss their plans with NICE public involvement staff. </p>
      <p>The proposal needs to be signed off by NICE staff with responsibility for quality assurance, and all comments and responses need to be publicly available, as with a routine stakeholder consultation. If the purpose of the additional consultation is to test the feasibility of implementing guideline recommendations, it may be useful to involve a member of the NICE field team for advice and support. </p>

      <p>The findings of the additional consultation and responses to consultees should be published alongside the final guideline, and the committee discussion section in the relevant evidence review should specify how the findings have affected the recommendations.</p>

      <p>Reasons for commissioned primary research will vary depending on the topic, and may become apparent at different stages of guideline development.</p>
      <p>New primary research can occasionally be useful when the committee's consensus is not sufficient for making recommendations, and a call for evidence or expert witness (see the <a class=\\"link\\" href=\\"appendix-j-call-for-evidence-and-expert-witnesses#appendix-j-call-for-evidence-and-expert-witnesses\\" target=\\"_top\\" rel=\\"internal\\" data-chapter=\\"appendix-j-call-for-evidence-and-expert-witnesses\\" data-original-url=\\"#appendix-j-call-for-evidence-and-expert-witnesses\\">appendix on call for evidence and expert witnesses</a>) is not appropriate or is not expected to produce the evidence that is needed. NICE and the developer may commission primary research to address specific review questions in areas where no published evidence was identified. </p>
      <p>Primary research could be commissioned, for example, when there is a lack of evidence on:</p>
      <div class=\\"itemizedlist\\">
        <ul class=\\"itemizedlist\\">
          <li class=\\"listitem\\">

          <li class=\\"listitem\\">
            <p>specific populations listed in the guideline scope (for example children and young people under 18). </p>

        <p>Once the aim of the commissioned primary research is agreed, the developer should then discuss the commissioning process with NICE staff with responsibility for quality assurance. Commissioned primary research is usually conducted by an external contractor. </p>
        <p>When the decision is made to commission an external contractor, the developer and NICE should consider an academic or research organisation, or an organisation that works with people affected by the guideline and has research expertise. This organisation should be separate from the team involved in compiling evidence reviews for the guideline and the committee, unless there are exceptional circumstances (for example, specific expertise in the topic or access to specialist networks is needed). However, the team may be asked to help the contractor, for example by generating a list of participants. </p>
        <p>The contractor should have a good record of research in the proposed field (for example qualitative or participatory research), and ideally should have experience in the topic area, as well as expertise in working with the people who will be affected by the guideline.</p>
        <p>The developer should document the reasons for the commissioned primary research, with a proposal including the methods to be used, and the anticipated time and costs. The proposal should be discussed with members of NICE staff with responsibility for quality assurance, and approved by the centre director. If the work is approved, the reasons and methods should be documented in the guideline.</p>
        <p>If an external contractor is commissioned, the commissioning process should follow NICE's Standing Financial Instructions. This involves developing a project specification, issuing invitations to tender and selecting a contractor based on clear and auditable criteria.</p>

      <p>Commissioned primary research can involve a number of approaches and methods. NICE, the relevant committee and the developer or external contractor should consider the choice of methods carefully, taking into account the topic, the groups involved and other issues. When involving people affected by the guideline, the methods and materials used should be tailored to the age, ability and culture of participants. Commissioned primary research may include the use of groups, 1-to-1 or paired in-depth interviews or surveys. In some cases – for example, if a range of groups are involved – a combination of approaches may be used.</p>

        <p>Interviews may be structured or semi-structured, depending on the topic and the groups involved. Semi-structured interviews allow complex or difficult issues to be explored and so are likely to be more useful than a fixed-format interview. They should focus on, for example, areas in which views and experiences are needed, or the draft recommendations. </p>
        <p>Individual or paired interviews are usually more expensive to set up than group work, and the need for in-depth or individual contact should be weighed against the available resources at the planning stage.</p>

        <p>Group-based methods and 1-to-1 or paired interviews are the best way to find out opinions. But they are not suitable in all circumstances, for example, because of the sensitivity of the topic, confidentiality issues, or difficulties in recruiting participants. In such cases, surveys that use semi-structured and open-ended questions could be more appropriate. Surveys may be carried out by telephone, online, on paper or by using vote casting or polling.</p>
        <p>Surveys gather opinions in a quick and less obtrusive manner than group-based approaches and interviews. The responses can also be quantified. But surveys do not allow the same depth of exploration and, generally, should only be used if other methods are unsuitable. Formal consensus methods such as <a class=\\"link\\" href=\\"https://www.nice.org.uk/process/pmg20/chapter/glossary#delphi-technique\\" target=\\"_top\\">Delphi survey</a> and RAND appropriateness could be modified for the survey if appropriate.</p>

      <div class=\\"section\\" title=\\"Analysis of data\\">
        <h5 class=\\"title\\">
          <a id=\\"analysis-of-data\\"></a>Analysis of data</h5>
        <p>There are different ways of analysing data from commissioned primary research, depending on the methods used for data collection and whether it is qualitative or quantitative. Some descriptive summary statistics should be provided, for example, characteristics of participants and attendance or response rates.</p>
        <p>Quantitative analysis should include a clear statistical data analysis plan, including a priori plans for sub-group analysis or co-variate adjustments.</p>
        <p>Group-based methods and interviews are likely to generate qualitative data. Analysis may be performed using qualitative research software, or by hand, but the method should be fully reported in the proposal and the final report. </p>
        <p>Qualitative data can be broken down into common and consistent themes for each of the questions asked, using, for example, a content analysis approach. Usually, 1 researcher should prepare an initial analysis, which should be verified by 'blind' coding and sorting of a sample of the transcript by a second researcher. For examples of this kind of analysis, see part 3 (chapters 7 to 13) of Silverman (2004) or Ritchie and Spencer (1993). </p>
        <p>Once the analysis is complete, participants' quotes may be selected to illustrate each theme. These quotes should be coded to keep participants anonymous and to allow the quotes to be distinguished. When transcripts are processed, ensure confidentiality and data protection are fully considered. As with data from clinical trials, transcripts should be kept for at least 5 years (see <a class=\\"link\\" href=\\"http://www.ct-toolkit.ac.uk/\\" target=\\"_top\\">www.ct-toolkit.ac.uk</a>).</p>
        <p>Surveys are likely to involve a mixture of quantitative and qualitative data. Quantitative data may be analysed and presented using summary statistics, or involve more advanced approaches such as regression analysis and multi-variable adjustments (which need agreeing a priori). These could be generated using various statistical software or calculators. When formal consensus methods such as Delphi survey and RAND appropriateness have been modified for the survey, specific analytical methods, for example, thresholds for agreement, should be stated in the proposal and the final report.</p>
        <p>The developer or external contractor (if commissioned) should ensure the methods for analysing the data and reporting standards are discussed and agreed with NICE.</p>

      <p>In principle, most primary research that is commissioned for NICE guidelines falls into the category of 'service evaluation' and so is outside the remit of NHS research ethics committees. However, NICE, the developer and external contractor (if commissioned) should consider the ethical issues each time commissioned primary research is planned, to ensure appropriate expertise, and that policies and procedures are in place for the safety and welfare of participants. If there is any doubt, the developer or external contractor should consult the national <a class=\\"link\\" href=\\"https://www.hra.nhs.uk/about-us/committees-and-services/res-and-recs/\\" target=\\"_top\\">Research Ethics Service</a>. The developer or external contractor (if commissioned) is responsible for seeking ethical approval, if it is needed.</p>
      <p>For topics covering children and young people, <a class=\\"link\\" href=\\"https://www.nice.org.uk/about/nice-communities/public-involvement/patient-and-public-involvement-policy\\" target=\\"_top\\">NICE's patient and public involvement policy</a> includes a set of principles for involving them and has an appendix about safeguarding. The national <a class=\\"link\\" href=\\"https://www.hra.nhs.uk/about-us/committees-and-services/res-and-recs/\\" target=\\"_top\\">Research Ethics Service</a> should also be consulted for topics covering children and young people and other vulnerable groups such as adults with learning disabilities or frail older people.</p>

      <p>The final report of the commissioned primary research should follow the same structure as the proposal. It should include sections on aim and objectives, recruiting participants, methods used, analysis of data and all the findings from the primary research.</p>
      <p>The developer should conduct a formal critical appraisal of the final report, using appropriate checklists from the <a class=\\"link\\" href=\\"https://www.nice.org.uk/process/pmg20/resources/developing-nice-guidelines-the-manual-appendices-2549710189/chapter/appendix-h-appraisal-checklists-evidence-tables-grade-and-economic-profiles\\" target=\\"_top\\">appendix on appraisal checklists, evidence tables, GRADE and economic profiles</a>. For example, the CASP checklist will be suitable for commissioned primary research that uses qualitative methods such as focus groups or 1-to-1 interview.</p>
      <p>The findings and the quality of the evidence should be presented to the guideline committee and used to inform the guideline recommendations. The developer may present a summary of all the findings to the committee, and the committee should use this information to refine and prioritise the recommendations before the public consultation. How the findings are used to inform committee's decision-making should be documented in the discussion section of the evidence reviews. The final report of the commissioned primary research should be made available for the routine stakeholder consultation as appendices of the guideline.</p>
