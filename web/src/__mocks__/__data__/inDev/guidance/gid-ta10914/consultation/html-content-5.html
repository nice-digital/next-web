	<p><strong>About the consultation</strong></p>
	<p>We have asked some questions about the consultation that we would like you to answer. You will be able to see the questions when you go into the online consultation document.&nbsp;</p>
	<p>We would also like you to think about whether there are any aspects of the recommendations that need particular consideration to make sure we avoid unlawful discrimination against any group of people. For example, on the grounds of:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>race</li>
	<li>sex</li>
	<li>disability</li>
	<li>religion or belief</li>
	<li>sexual orientation</li>
	<li>age</li>
	<li>gender reassignment</li>
	<li>pregnancy and maternity.</li>
	</ul>
	<p><strong>Note that this document is not NICE's final guidance on this technology. The recommendations in section 1 may change after consultation.</strong></p>
	<p>After the consultation has closed the appraisal committee will meet again to consider the responses received and prepare the final draft guidance.</p>
