They can be accessed online or through an app, and provide a multidisciplinary programme and support from the service's multidisciplinary team (MDT) of healthcare professionals. Some technologies offer weight-management medicine prescribing and medicine reviews with a prescribing clinician, alongside regular reviews with other members of the service's MDT. The frequency of reviews may vary depending on the technology, user preference and stage of the programme. These technologies can be used to support multidisciplinary weight-management services, including treatment with weight-management medicine. NICE has assessed 12 technologies that can deliver multidisciplinary weight-management services. The criteria for including technologies in this early value assessment (EVA) and further details for technologies that prescribe and monitor weight-management medicine are in <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/hte14/history\" target=\"_top\">Section 2.2, Table 2 and Appendix E of the assessment report, and in the assessment report addendum on the NICE website</a>. For technologies that deliver multidisciplinary weight-management services when they are not used to prescribe and monitor weight-management medicine, further details are in the <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/gid-hte10023/documents/final-scope\" target=\"_top\">final scope</a> for the assessment.
