Acute kidney injury is sudden damage to the kidneys, which can sometimes result in kidney failure. The quality standard includes assessment by non-specialists and when to refer to specialist services. It describes high-quality care in priority areas for improvement.</p>\n<p>It does not cover care for adults with kidney failure provided by renal replacement therapy services, which is included in <a href=\"https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/qs72\">NICE&rsquo;s quality standard on renal replacement therapy services for adults</a>. It does not cover managing acute kidney injury in pregnant women or in people with a kidney transplant.</p>\n<h2>How to use NICE quality standards and how we develop them</h2>\n<p>Quality standards help you improve the quality of care you provide or commission. They apply in England and Wales (see the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/national-institute-for-clinical-excellence\">UK government website</a> and <a href=\"https://gov.wales/national-institute-health-and-care-excellence-nice-guidelines\">Welsh government website</a>). Decisions on how they apply in Scotland and Northern Ireland are made by ministers in the Scottish government and Northern Ireland Executive.</p>\n<p>Find out <a href=\"https://www.nice.org.uk/standards-and-indicators/how-to-use-quality-standards\">how to use quality standards</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nice.org.uk/standards-and-indicators/timeline-developing-quality-standards\">how we develop them</a>.
