Additional consultation is a targeted engagement exercise <a id=\"_Hlk71020670\"></a>to obtain a range of views, experiences and expertise, independent from the committee. This can be done either to inform the draft recommendations, or to test the feasibility of implementing the draft recommendations or their relevance and acceptability to those who use the guideline or who will be affected by the guideline. </p>\r\n  <p>Commissioned primary research can occasionally be useful for addressing topic areas where there is limited or no evidence. Commissioned primary research usually uses methods such as focus groups, interviews or online surveys. It involves health and care professionals, people using services and carers, or both. Commissioned primary research may also include quantitative analysis of real-world data sources such as audit datasets. The research should happen during the development of the guideline (before routine stakeholder consultation), and the committee should use the findings as part of the evidence base for developing recommendations.</p>\r\n  <p>This appendix outlines approaches that could be used and minimum reporting standards for additional consultation and commissioned primary research. </p>\r\n  <p>Additional consultation and commissioned primary research follow the same process: </p>\r\n  <div class=\"itemizedlist\">\r\n    <ul class=\"itemizedlist\">\r\n      <li class=\"listitem\">\r\n        <p>decide whether additional consultation or commissioned primary research is needed </p>\r\n      </li>\r\n      <li class=\"listitem\">\r\n        <p>establish the aims and objectives of additional consultation or commissioned primary research</p>\r\n      </li>\r\n      <li class=\"listitem\">\r\n        <p>follow the recruitment process and (for commissioned primary research) commissioning process </p>\r\n      </li>\r\n      <li class=\"listitem\">\r\n        <p>establish the methods and process of the consultation or research activity</p>\r\n      </li>\r\n      <li class=\"listitem\">\r\n        <p>consider whether ethical approval is needed (for commissioned primary research)</p>\r\n      </li>\r\n      <li class=\"listitem\">\r\n        <p>agree the proposal and timeframe of the additional consultation or commissioned primary research (including key milestones that align with guideline development timeframes; <a class=\"link\" href=\"appendix-b-approaches-to-additional-consultation-and-commissioned-primary-research#example-of-key-milestones\" target=\"_top\" rel=\"internal\" data-chapter=\"appendix-b-approaches-to-additional-consultation-and-commissioned-primary-research\" data-original-url=\"#example-of-key-milestones\">see box 1 for an example of key milestones</a>)</p>\r\n      </li>\r\n      <li class=\"listitem\">\r\n        <p>report findings (this includes submitting drafts, and revising them if needed after comments from the developer and committee). </p>\r\n      </li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"section\" title=\"Additional consultation\">\r\n    <h3 class=\"title\">\r\n      <a id=\"additional-consultation\"></a>Additional consultation</h3>\r\n    <div class=\"section\" title=\"Deciding whether additional consultation is needed\">\r\n      <h4 class=\"title\">\r\n        <a id=\"deciding-whether-additional-consultation-is-needed\"></a>Deciding whether additional consultation is needed</h4>\r\n      <p>Reasons for additional consultation will vary depending on the topic, and may become apparent at different stages of guideline development.</p>\r\n      <p>The process for additional consultation is similar to the process for routine stakeholder consultation.

Semi-structured interviews allow complex or difficult issues to be explored and so are likely to be more useful than a fixed-format interview. They should focus on, for example, areas in which views and experiences are needed, or the draft recommendations. </p>\r\n        <p>Individual or paired interviews are usually more expensive to set up than group work, and the need for in-depth or individual contact should be weighed against the available resources at the planning stage.</p>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div class=\"section\" title=\"Surveys\">\r\n        <h5 class=\"title\">\r\n          <a id=\"surveys\"></a>Surveys</h5>\r\n        <p>Group-based methods and 1-to-1 or paired interviews are the best way to find out opinions. But they are not suitable in all circumstances, for example, because of the sensitivity of the topic, confidentiality issues, or difficulties in recruiting participants. In such cases, surveys that use semi-structured and open-ended questions could be more appropriate. Surveys may be carried out by telephone, online, on paper or by using vote casting or polling.</p>\r\n        <p>Surveys gather opinions in a quick and less obtrusive manner than group-based approaches and interviews. The responses can also be quantified. But surveys do not allow the same depth of exploration and, generally, should only be used if other methods are unsuitable. Formal consensus methods such as <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.nice.org.uk/process/pmg20/chapter/glossary#delphi-technique\" target=\"_top\">Delphi survey</a> and RAND appropriateness could be modified for the survey if appropriate.</p>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div class=\"section\" title=\"Analysis of data\">\r\n        <h5 class=\"title\">\r\n          <a id=\"analysis-of-data\"></a>Analysis of data</h5>\r\n        <p>There are different ways of analysing data from commissioned primary research, depending on the methods used for data collection and whether it is qualitative or quantitative. Some descriptive summary statistics should be provided, for example, characteristics of participants and attendance or response rates.</p>\r\n        <p>Quantitative analysis should include a clear statistical data analysis plan, including a priori plans for sub-group analysis or co-variate adjustments.</p>\r\n        <p>Group-based methods and interviews are likely to generate qualitative data. Analysis may be performed using qualitative research software, or by hand, but the method should be fully reported in the proposal and the final report. </p>\r\n        <p>Qualitative data can be broken down into common and consistent themes for each of the questions asked, using, for example, a content analysis approach. Usually, 1 researcher should prepare an initial analysis, which should be verified by 'blind' coding and sorting of a sample of the transcript by a second researcher. For examples of this kind of analysis, see part 3 (chapters 7 to 13) of Silverman (2004) or Ritchie and Spencer (1993). </p>\r\n        <p>Once the analysis is complete, participants' quotes may be selected to illustrate each theme. These quotes should be coded to keep participants anonymous and to allow the quotes to be distinguished. When transcripts are processed, ensure confidentiality and data protection are fully considered. As with data from clinical trials, transcripts should be kept for at least 5 years (see <a class=\"link\" href=\"http://www.ct-toolkit.ac.uk/\" target=\"_top\">www.ct-toolkit.ac.uk</a>).</p>\r\n        <p>Surveys are likely to involve a mixture of quantitative and qualitative data. Quantitative data may be analysed and presented using summary statistics, or involve more advanced approaches such as regression analysis and multi-variable adjustments (which need agreeing a priori). These could be generated using various statistical software or calculators. When formal consensus methods such as Delphi survey and RAND appropriateness have been modified for the survey, specific analytical methods, for example, thresholds for agreement, should be stated in the proposal and the final report.</p>\r\n        <p>The developer or external contractor (if commissioned) should ensure the methods for analysing the data and reporting standards are discussed and agreed with NICE.</p>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div class=\"section\" title=\"Feedback mechanism\">\r\n        <h5 class=\"title\">\r\n          <a id=\"feedback-mechanism\"></a>Feedback mechanism</h5>\r\n        <p>The developer or external contractor should agree with NICE a process for giving feedback to all participants.
