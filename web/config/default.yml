# ! This file contains default config values for both 'public' config (accessible to both client and server-side code) and 'server' config (server-only runtime config).
# ! See https://edibleco.de/3jILey1 for NextJS runtime config docs

# Public config values are accessible to both client and server-side code:
public:
  # Name of the environment e.g. dev,test etc, used for logging to ELK
  environment: local
  # The base part of the URL where the website it hosted e.g https://dev.nice.org.uk
  baseUrl: http://localhost:3000
  # URL of the cookie banner script. It's config driven so we can point to the alpha CDN on non-live environments or even use localhost
  cookieBannerScriptUrl: https://cdn.nice.org.uk/cookie-banner/cookie-banner.min.js
  # The path to the public static assets once deployed: https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/static-file-serving.
  # Defaults to an empty string which means serving static files from the root. E.g. ./web/public/favicon.ico would be served from /favicon.ico
  publicBaseUrl: ''

# ! This is a PUBLIC repo so please don't put any sensitive info or secrets in here
# ! Use local.yml or local.json to override settings locally instead: https://edibleco.de/3dLJKiP
# ! Server config is accessible to server-only so is great for secrets (like API keys etc):
server:
  cache:
    # Prefix added to all cache keys
    keyPrefix: next-web:local
    # The folder into which the feed cache is stored
    filePath: c:\.next-web-cache\
    # The default TTL (time to live) (aka expiry duration), in seconds, for the object cache
    defaultTTL: 86400
    # A longer TTL, in seconds, than the default, used for 'long-lived' cache entries that very rarely change.
    longTTL: 604800
    # Threshold for TTL, in seconds, below which object caches are refreshed in the background as per https://edibleco.de/3hyfpGG
    # Should be lower than defaultTTL.
    # Example: to check for fresh data every 5 minutes, it should be 300 seconds (5 * 60) lower than defaultTTL.
    refreshThreshold: 86100
