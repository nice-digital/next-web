# ! This file contains default config values for both 'public' config (accessible to both client and server-side code) and 'server' config (server-only runtime config).
# ! See https://edibleco.de/3jILey1 for NextJS runtime config docs

# Public config values are accessible to both client and server-side code:
public:
  # Name of the environment e.g. dev,test etc, used for logging to ELK
  environment: local
  # The base part of the URL where the website it hosted e.g https://dev.nice.org.uk
  baseUrl: http://localhost:3000

# ! This is a PUBLIC repo so please don't put any sensitive info or secrets in here
# ! Use local.yml or local.json to override settings locally instead: https://edibleco.de/3dLJKiP
# ! Server config is accessible to server-only so is great for secrets (like API keys etc):
server:
